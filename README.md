# mkw-structures
Notes about structures I've figured out in Mario Kart Wii, might be useful / interesting to some people.
These aren't designed to compile properly, unknowns are left out with offsets being given in comments.
Do whatever you like with this information as long as you credit me and anyone else I've credited in the parts you use.
