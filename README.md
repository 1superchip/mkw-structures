# mkw-structures
Notes about structures I've figured out in Mario Kart Wii, might be useful / interesting to some people.
These aren't designed to be used in actual programs, unknowns are left out with offsets being given in comments so it won't compile properly.
Do whatever you like with this information as long as you credit me and anyone else I've credited here for the information.
